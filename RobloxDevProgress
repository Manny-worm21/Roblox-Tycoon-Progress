I decided to play around with making Roblox games and learning about the Lua language on there. I does seem complicated at first, but it can be understandable after watching a few tutorials.
It does seem interesting to do and I could see myself passionately making more games later on down the road. Though it does have a tough debugging process with how different objects interact with one another.
